  <h2>The Sonic Wallpaper of My Skull</h2> 
  <p>
    Since the start, I've enjoyed "the wrong ear" that my cousins used to call mine. While they were out there dancing to whatever Metro FM was serving, or yelling boy band choruses along the school corridor, I was crouched in a corner somewhere with my Discman, yelling out The Offspring's <em>Self Esteem</em> like a chant: "My friend's got a girlfriend and he despises that bitch."
    <br><br>
    I wasn't supposed to hear that. That's the catch, music, to me, was never a case of "supposed to." It was a case of honesty. Not the buffed, sterilized, chart-friendly kind... I required music that was uncooked, that smelled of basement gigs and bad life decisions. The kind that was too raw to make the radio, and too real to make best-of lists from people trying to sell toothpaste between songs.
    <br><br>
    I chose the underground ones because they spoke to me. I wasn't chart-in-love. That wasn't my life. I ached for the late-night confessionals, the rage diary-writing turned into music, the broken person's desperate poetry that continues to strive. Whether it was the soul-punched sound of Alice in Chains, the jazzy sleeplessness of Robert Glasper, or the alien madness of Björk... I chased the ones that spoke to the madness in me. Loud. Soft. Strange.
    <br><br>
    And I didn’t just carry global chaos within me, I also brought my South African soul with me. Brenda Fassie on Sunday mornings. Zola when I needed to toughen up. Tumi when I needed to see clearly. Thandiswa when I needed to recall home. Even old kwaito rhythms, infested with tsotsi, taught me a thing or two about story. There is rhythm to the way we mourn here. There is song in how we laugh away our bruises. You don't simply hear South African music — you feel it in your gut and in your kneecaps.
    <br><br>
    No one really understood. "Why don't you just make a normal playlist?" they'd say. But to me, that was like asking someone to write a love note in Arial. No way, man. My playlist was penned in blood, Sharpied on napkins, in a million faces and voices. That was how I coped. The way I made sense of why my brain felt like a haunted house sometimes... why I couldn't just "vibe" like everyone else.
    <br><br>
    For me, music wasn’t just music. It was medicine. Mirror. Rebellion and comfort at the same time. It wasn't just noise, it was proof I wasn't alone. It was the audio wallpaper of my cranium, layered, louder, and carrying hidden messages that only the freaks could read.
    <br><br>
    Then one time, everything changed. I started to hear songs in my own head. Lyrics stuck to my lips like lines waiting to be written. I quit looking for songs that told my story... and started to write the ones that do. Somewhere between avoiding radio hits and decoding underground verses, I was summoned. Not by popularity. Not by the charts. By something deeper. Something holy.
    <br><br>
    That is how the listener became the artist.

                        <p>
                            I have stood in the smoke of burning incense, watching blood darken the soil as elders murmured the names of those who came before me. I have lifted a calabash to my lips, felt the thick, bitter taste of umqombothi coat my tongue, and swallowed the weight of tradition. I have clapped my hands, stomped my feet, and called on ancestors whose names live only in the mouths of the old.
                            And then, just as the fire cracked and the meat sizzled, someone started a hymn. “There is power in the blood of the Lamb!” The same hands that held the blade to a goat’s throat now raised themselves in worship. Drunken voices, thick with belief and contradiction, declared that Jesus is the only way.
                            I grew up here. Between two worlds. Between libations poured for those beneath the soil and prayers whispered to the man who walked on water. Between bones thrown in the dust and a Bible laid on a wooden table. I grew up watching my people give offerings to ancestors and then kneel in church, ashamed of the very rituals they performed the night before.
                            What are we? A people torn between who we were and who we were forced to become. A people who fear turning our backs on the old ways but also fear hell for not embracing the new. We are a prayer with two tongues, a faith split down the middle, bleeding both ways.
                            And maybe that’s why, no matter how loud we sing, neither God nor our ancestors answer us the way we wish they would.

                        <p>
                            I’m not angry… not at you, not at fate, <br>
                            not at the knife you slid between my ribs, <br>
                            slow, deliberate, like a lover’s hand <br>
                            tracing the spine of a dying romance. <br>
                            <br>
                            You only taught me what I needed to know, <br>
                            that trust is a borrowed cigarette, <br>
                            lit in the wind, smoked too fast, <br>
                            burning out before warmth ever settles. <br><br>
                            I should’ve known better… now I do.<br>
                            Your betrayal wasn’t a wound, <br>
                            just a lesson written in blood, <br>
                            signed with a smirk… and silence.<br><br>
                            No hard feelings… just a closed door.<br><br>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You don’t cheat, congratulations. You kept your hands to yourself, but did you keep your heart open? You stayed, but did you show up? You were present, but did you participate?
                            Love is not a courtroom where fidelity is your only defense. You think not stepping out makes you step up? No. You can be faithful and still be a storm your partner has to survive.
                            Because what is loyalty if your love is lazy… if your words cut… if your silence drowns… if your presence feels like absence? What is faith if the only thing you give is yourself, only when it’s convenient, only when it doesn't cost you?
                            So, I ask again: what is loyalty if it’s not love in action? What is it really worth?
