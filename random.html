	    <h2 class="thought-title">The Lesson </h2>
            <p>I’m not angry… not at you, not at fate,<br>
not at the knife you slid between my ribs,<br>
slow, deliberate, like a lover’s hand<br>
tracing the spine of a dying romance.<br>
<br>
You only taught me what I needed to know,<br>
that trust is a borrowed cigarette,<br>
lit in the wind, smoked too fast,<br>
burning out before warmth ever settles.<br><br>

I should’ve known better… now I do.<br>
Your betrayal wasn’t a wound,<br>
just a lesson written in blood,<br>
signed with a smirk… and silence.<br><br>

No hard feelings… just a closed door.<br><br></p>
	</div> 
     <h2 class="thought-title"> Two Altars, One Truth! </h2>
            <p>
		I have stood in the smoke of burning incense, watching blood darken the soil as elders murmured the names of those who came before me. I have lifted a calabash to my lips, felt the thick, bitter taste of umqombothi coat my tongue, and swallowed the weight of tradition. I have clapped my hands, stomped my feet, and called on ancestors whose names live only in the mouths of the old.
		And then, just as the fire cracked and the meat sizzled, someone started a hymn. “There is power in the blood of the Lamb!” The same hands that held the blade to a goat’s throat now raised themselves in worship. Drunken voices, thick with belief and contradiction, declared that Jesus is the only way.
		I grew up here. Between two worlds. Between libations poured for those beneath the soil and prayers whispered to the man who walked on water. Between bones thrown in the dust and a Bible laid on a wooden table. I grew up watching my people give offerings to ancestors and then kneel in church, ashamed of the very rituals they performed the night before.
		What are we? A people torn between who we were and who we were forced to become. A people who fear turning our backs on the old ways but also fear hell for not embracing the new. We are a prayer with two tongues, a faith split down the middle, bleeding both ways.
		And maybe that’s why, no matter how loud we sing, neither God nor our ancestors answer us the way we wish they would.

            <h2 class="thought-title">Faithful, but Failing </h2>
            <p>You don’t cheat, congratulations. You kept your hands to yourself, but did you keep your heart open? You stayed, but did you show up? You were present, but did you participate?
			Love is not a courtroom where fidelity is your only defense. You think not stepping out makes you step up? No. You can be faithful and still be a storm your partner has to survive.
			Because what is loyalty if your love is lazy… if your words cut… if your silence drowns… if your presence feels like absence? What is commitment if you’re selfish, unreliable, inconsistent… if your love is a ghost, haunting the spaces where effort should be?
			You do not get to sit on the throne of "great partner" just because you didn’t betray. Faithfulness is not an achievement, it’s the floor, the foundation, the bare minimum.
			Because love is not just where you don’t go… it’s where you choose to be.</p>

            <h2 class="thought-title">Love Ain’t Soft, Love Ain’t Safe</h2>
            <p>It doesn’t live in fairy tales or white wedding lace. <br>
                Love is kasi dust in your teeth, <br>
                taxi horns and struggle songs, <br>
                it’s mama’s tired hands still braiding your dreams<br>
                long after hers were buried in the backyard of sacrifice.<br>
                <br>
                If love don’t change you,<br>
                if it don’t shift your bones like a shack in a storm,<br>
                then what you had was comfort, not love.<br>
                <br>
                Love is that mkhukhu with no lights,<br>
                but still warm when the world gets cold.<br>
                It’s sharing half a kota ‘cause that’s all you got,<br>
                and laughing like you just had a feast.<br>
                It’s standing in a protest, fists up,<br>
                knowing bullets don’t care about your dreams.<br>
                <br>
                Friendship? Yoh, real friendship is deeper than blood,<br>
                it’s borrowed sneakers for a first date,<br>
                it’s hiding your boy’s hustle from his mama,<br>
                it’s knowing who ate last night and who didn’t.<br>
                <br>
                They sold us love in telenovelas,<br>
                taught us friendship was just vibes,<br>
                but here?<br>
                Love is a fight. Love is survival.<br>
                Love is holding on, even when the world lets go.<br></p>

            <p>They call me Umlilo, the fire that never cools, <br>
                Ngibizwa ngegama, and you answer like a fool.<br>
                Ngiy’thinta kancane, you think you in control,<br>
                but I creep slow, like a shadow in your soul.<br>

                Aw’phaphami, eyes red, hands itchy,<br>
                Stealing from mama, selling baba’s TV.<br>
                Kasi boys know me, the girls call me sweet,<br>
                but I leave them broken, beggin’ in the street.<br>
                <br>
                I teach you new lessons… how to twist, how to lie,<br>
                How to sell your last sneaker just to get high.<br>
                Ngiyagwinya, I swallow you whole,<br>
                Turn warriors to beggars, leave stories untold.<br>
                Usazibona? Look deep in the glass,<br>
                Your face is a ghost, a memory past.<br>
                <br>
                I take dreams from gogo, and futures from kids,<br>
                Turn pastors to sinners, and lovers to thieves.<br>
                Ngizokususa kuNkulunkulu, make you forget,<br>
                Your prayers turn to whispers… regret after regret.<br>
                <br>
                At first, I’m your friend, a soft, warm embrace,<br>
                But soon I’m your master, your life I erase.<br>
                Awusangwazi ekhaya, ‘cause you lost all your pride,<br>
                You sold it for powder, for one final ride.<br>
                <br>
                I take and take, ‘til you got nothing left,<br>
                No family, no soul… just pain and regret.<br>
                And when I’m done? When I leave you to die?<br>
                Your name’s just an echo, lost in the sky.<br>
                <br>
                Ngibiza ngegama… will you answer me still?<br>
                Or will you fight back, reclaiming your will?</p>
