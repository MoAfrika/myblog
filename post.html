            <article>
                <p>On May 24th last year, I lost my mom to cancer. In the days that followed, it felt like the world had suddenly quieted, like someone hit the mute button on my life’s soundtrack. We laid her to rest on June 1st, a day that didn’t just mark the end of her journey—it marked the beginning of my reflection on all the dreams she set aside to make ours possible.</p>

                <blockquote class="blockquote">“My mother was a miner, and we were her precious stones—each of us a bit rough around the edges, but sparkling with potential.”</blockquote>

                <p>Growing up, I saw my mother as just that—my mother. She was the keeper of order, the unwavering voice of reason, the one who made sure we had what we needed. It’s only now that I realize she was also a woman with her own ambitions, ones that didn’t always fit within the life she chose.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">What Would Mama Do?</h2>

                <p>She wanted to be a journalist once. She dreamed of traveling, of studying more, of building something beyond what circumstances allowed. But she was also a mother, and for her, family wasn’t a detour .... it was the destination. She poured everything into us, and in doing so, she made sure we had the opportunities she never did.</p>

                <blockquote class="blockquote">“She gave up her dreams so I could have mine; now I carry them both.”</blockquote>

                <p>Now that she’s gone, I find myself asking, What would Mama do? Not just in the little decisions—like how to handle a bad day—but in the bigger ones, the ones that define a life. <br>Would she have taken the risks I hesitate to take? Would she have pushed herself further if she had just a little more time? 

I think about this a lot because her sacrifices weren’t just about survival. They were investments .... in me, in my siblings, in the future she wanted us to have. And if I don’t chase my dreams, if I don’t step into all the spaces she carved open for me, then what was it all for?</p>

                <p>But here’s the thing about loss: it doesn’t come neatly wrapped in life lessons. It brings chaos. The kind that turns family into strangers and home into something unfamiliar. After she passed, we weren’t the same. The grief didn’t bring us together ..... it fractured us. It changed us....It changed, me.</p>

                <p>I coped the way I knew how .... by numbing. By avoiding. By retreating into the spaces where I didn’t have to feel too much. It took time for me to realize that the best way to honor my mother wasn’t to drown in what I’d lost, but to build on what she left behind.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Continuing Her Legacy</h2>

                <p>I keep coming back to the thought: If she had my opportunities, what would she have done with them? That’s the question that drives me now. Not just in my career, but in the way I choose to live. My mother lived for us. I want to live in a way that would make her say, Yes, that’s exactly what I would have done too.</p>

                <p>That’s why I’m building something in her honor.... A way to carry forward the dreams she never got to fulfill. A way to make sure her sacrifices weren’t just the foundation for my success, but a legacy that stretches beyond me.</p>
